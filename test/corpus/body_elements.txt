=======================
Indented literal blocks
=======================

This is a typical paragraph. An indented literal block follows.

::

    for a in [5,4,3,2,1]:   # this is program code, shown as-is
        print a
    print "it's..."
    # a literal block continues until the indentation ends

Ordinary paragraph.

Another indented block::

 > I'm the *content*
 I'm the *content*

Another indented block: ::

                I'm the content

indented block?::
    
    Indented
 Still indented

The following is a literal block::

    >>> This is not recognized as a doctest block by
    reStructuredText.  It *will* be recognized by the doctest
    module, though!

You just did!  ;-)

Another indented block::

Another indented block: ::

indented block?::

| Lend us a couple of bob till Thursday.

Take it away, Eric the Orchestra Leader!

| A one, two, a one two three four

| Half a bee, philosophically,
|     must, **ipso facto**, half not be.
| But half the bee has got to be,
|     *vis a vis* its entity.  D'you see?
|
| But can a bee be said to be
|     or not to be an entire bee,
|         when half the bee is not a bee,
|             due to some ancient injury?

| Singing...
